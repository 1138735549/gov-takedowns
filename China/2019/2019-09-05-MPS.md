您好！我代表中国公安部网络安全保卫局，向贵公司举报贵平台上出现的有关邪教“法轮功”的违法链接（详见附件1）。

“法轮功”已被我国界定为邪教，触犯了我国刑法、未成年人保护法等法律法规。其中，我国《刑法》第三百条规定：组织和利用会道门、邪教组织或者利用迷信破坏国家法律、行政法规实施，处三年以上七年以下有期徒刑，情节特别严重的，处七年以上有期徒刑。《最高人民法院最高人民检察院关于办理组织和利用邪教组织犯罪案件具体应用法律若干问题的解释（二）》明确规定：制作、传播邪教宣传品，宣扬邪教，破坏法律、行政法规实施的，应当依照刑法第三百条第一款的规定，以组织、利用邪教组织破坏法律实施罪定罪处罚。

根据上述我国法律法规明确规定，我局建议贵公司清除附件1链接中的涉及法轮功的信息，如果可以的话，最好能够封禁相关发布者账号（附件2）。如果贵公司认为上述做法影响较大，请至少让来自中国IP地址的访问用户看不到上述附件1链接中的法轮功信息。

谢谢。
